# Credit-Risk-Assessment
Welcome to my README.md, where I documented a comprehensive machine learning project. This project involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). Here's a detailed walkthrough of each stage in the notebook.

## 1. Introduction
In this notebook, I guided you through various stages of a machine learning pipeline, including:

Data preprocessing
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Standardizing the data
Training and evaluating models
Performing feature selection using RFE
Saving the trained model
## 2. Setup and Imports
First, I imported the necessary libraries that I used throughout the project. This included libraries for data manipulation, model training, evaluation, and feature selection.

## 3. Loading the Data
Next, I loaded my dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. This step was crucial as it allowed me to manipulate and analyze the data easily.

## 4. Data Preprocessing
In this stage, I performed initial data preprocessing. This involved handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Proper preprocessing ensured that the data was clean and suitable for model training.

## 5. Splitting the Data
I then split the dataset into training and testing sets. This was essential to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.

## 6. Standardizing the Data
Standardization was a key step in data preprocessing. Here, I standardized the features using StandardScaler, which scaled the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This step ensured that the features contributed equally to the model's learning process.

## 7. Training the Model
With the data prepared, I proceeded to train an XGBoost model. XGBoost is a powerful and efficient implementation of gradient boosting that is widely used for structured data.

## 8. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)
To further improve the model, I performed hyperparameter tuning. This involved searching for the best combination of parameters that maximized the model's performance. I used GridSearchCV for this task, which performed an exhaustive search over specified parameter values.

## 9. Feature Elimination Using RFE
Next, I applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most important features. RFE helped in improving the model's performance by reducing the feature space and eliminating irrelevant features. This step involved fitting the model multiple times while recursively eliminating the least important features.

## 10. Saving the RFE Model
After selecting the important features, I saved the RFE model using pickle. This allowed me to reuse the trained model without needing to retrain it from scratch in the future.

## 11. Conclusion
This notebook demonstrated a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, feature selection, and saving the trained model. Each step was crucial in building a robust and accurate machine learning model. Feel free to adjust the steps to fit your specific dataset and project requirements.

This README provide an overview and step-by-step instructions for running and understanding the notebook. Follow each stage sequentially to ensure a smooth workflow and achieve the best results.
